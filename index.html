        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>1. Introduction<br>
        Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle any personal data related to your use of the App.</p>
        
        <p>2. Information Collection and Use<br>
        We do not require user accounts; thus, we do not collect personal information. The App interacts with users without any personal data collection or storage.</p>
        
        <p>3. Speech Recognition<br>
        We utilize iOS's native speech recognition technology. No voice data is recorded, stored, or monitored by our App.</p>
        
        <p>4. Data Storage<br>
        All generated content, including dialogues and memory nodes, is stored locally and not backed up. Data will be permanently lost if the App is uninstalled. Plans for iCloud synchronization are under consideration for future updates.</p>
        
        <p>5. Information Sharing<br>
        We do not share any data with third parties since no personal data is collected.</p>
        
        <p>6. Security<br>
        We implement reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.</p>
        
        <p>7. Changes to Privacy Policy<br>
        We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by updating this page. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
